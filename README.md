# ContactManager
This is a Restfull API application for managing contacts. You can perform CRUD operations by making restful calls to this application. I have used Web API to implement restful service, Nunit for wrting testcases. This application uses static class for sample data operations, However this application can be easily configured to use other data solution by providing dependancy. For Dependancy injection i have used Ninject IoC container.
